<b> Kaldi </b>
<li> Each Kaldi BASH recipe contains a list of CONFIG variables at the very
top. Before every run, one needs to just worry about the value of these 
variables. This saves us from going through the long scripts every 
time. If one wants to add new variables, it's best to include them in this 
configuration section. NOTE: The values of CONFIG variables can be 
overriden by those called from the command-line. The script 
parse_options.sh enables this. </li>

<li> Kaldi BASH recipes are split into several STAGES. In case a recipe 
crashes in between at a particular stage, in the next run, one can skip 
running stages which had completed successfully, and start running the 
recipe from the point where it had stopped. This helps save a lot of 
time. </li> 

<li> There's an echo statement inside every stage which has two benefits.
First, while going through the code, it informs the user what processing
that stage does. Second, during run-time we come to know which stage of
the recipe is currently running. </li>

<li> Typically, a Kaldi recipe calls several other recipes. 
An echo statement (described above) of the form "echo $@: stage info"
also helps the user know which sub-recipe is currently running, 
and at which stage. In case of any failure, it helps us to directly 
reach the point of problem. </li>
