<b> Kaldi </b>
<li> Each Kaldi BASH recipe contains a list of CONFIG variables at the very
top. Before every run, one needs to just worry about the value of these 
variables. This saves us from going through long the long scripts every 
time. If one wants to add new variables, it's best to include them in this 
configuration section. NOTE: The values of CONFIG variables can be 
overriden by those called from the command-line. The script 
parse_options.sh enables this. </li>

<li> Kaldi BASH recipes are split into several STAGES. In case a recipe 
crashes in between at a particular stage, one can skip running stages
which had completed successfully. This helps save a lot of time. </li> 

<li> There's an echo statement inside every stage to inform the user during run-time where is the recipe hanging around. </li>
<li> A Kaldi recipe calls several other recipes. An echo statement like "echo $@: stage info" .. informs the user which sub-recipe is running, and at which stage. In case of any failure, it helps to directly reach the point of problem. </li>
</ul>
