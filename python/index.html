Func_name.__doc__ gives the docstring of the function. We can see the docstring of a function like append or module like numpy. 
Function args can NOT be named args followed by unnamed args. 
dir(module/function/object) lists all attributes. Try dir(list) or dir(numpy).
Everything in Python is an object. Even functions are objects in Python. 
This is important, so I’m going to repeat it in case you missed it the first few times: everything in Python is an object. Strings are objects. Lists are objects. Functions are objects. Classes are objects. Class instances are objects. Even modules are objects. 

Every function returns. When there is no explicit return statement used, that function returns None. 
There are two kinds of functions/things. One is object’s, other one is built-in. 
The source code for built-in functions is not available as that is not written in Python, but is written in C. See this .. at http://www.diveintopython3.net/your-first-python-program.html#divingin
Actually, I lied; the truth is more complicated than that, because not all modules are stored as .py files. Some are built-in modules; they are actually baked right into Python itself. Built-in modules behave just like regular modules, but their Python source code is not available, because they are not written in Python! (Like Python itself, these built-in modules are written in C.) 

Python is a dynamically typed and strongly typed language. It’s not statically and loosely typed language. 
Python searches for modules in directories listed in sys.path.
